## üöÄ Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

You need a modern web browser. For the best experience and to avoid potential CORS issues with local files, it's recommended to use a live server. If you have VS Code, the **Live Server** extension is a great choice.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/estate-elite.git](https://github.com/your-username/estate-elite.git)
    ```
2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd estate-elite
    ```

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run the Project

### 1. Running the Main Web Application

1.  Open the project folder in your code editor (e.g., VS Code).
2.  Right-click on the `home.html` file.
3.  Select "Open with Live Server" (or your equivalent).
4.  Your browser will open with the project running.

### 2. Running the Image Downloader Utility (Optional)

The `download.js` script is a utility to fetch images.

1.  **Open the script**: Open the `download.js` file.
2.  **Add your API Key**: Replace the placeholder API key with your own key from Pixabay.
    ```javascript
    // download.js
    const apiKey = 'YOUR_PIXABAY_API_KEY';
    ```
3.  **Run the script from your terminal**:
    ```bash
    node download.js

## üìÇ Project Structure

The project is organized with a clear and intuitive file structure.
You are absolutely right. It looks like some of our previous conversation and explanations were accidentally copied into the file along with the README content, causing the repetitions and formatting issues.

My apologies for the confusion.

Here is the clean, corrected, and de-duplicated version. This is the single, complete README.md file that you can copy and paste directly into GitHub.

## üîÆ Future Improvements

This project has a solid foundation. Here are some potential features to add in the future:

-   **Full Backend Integration**: Replace the hardcoded JavaScript data arrays with a robust backend (e.g., Node.js, Express) and a database (e.g., MongoDB, PostgreSQL) for dynamic data management.
-   **Real User Accounts**: Implement a complete authentication system with password hashing and session management.
-   **Dynamic "Add Property" Feature**: Integrate a geocoding API to automatically get coordinates for a new property's address.
-   **Deployment**: Deploy the final application to a hosting service like Netlify, Vercel, or Gi
